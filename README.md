# mas-deployer


This repository helps you deploy Maximo Application Suite in a semi automatic manner ; or at least understand all steps to achieve a MAS deployment.
You have to modify all \*.properties files to match your settings (ER_KEY is entitlement key, storage classes, etc).
This repository replace the mas86Deployer, as MAS evolves quite quickly. This version does not stuck to a number, but install all latest prereq and MAS versions.
